**ShallowEndr**
===========
ShallowEndr is a crowdsourced music discovery app that helps you figure out the best song to start with from a new artist.  Users of the app will cast a vote for an artists most approachable song.  This will give new listeners a better starting point than by just checking out the artists radio friendly singles.

We are still working on adding features and increasing UX.  We are also looking into other API providers due to the slow response time.

As of now, a user has the ability to vote for one song per artist.  To vote for a song, click on the music icon next to the songs name.  To remove a vote, click on the star next to the songs name.

Right now the API is pretty slow when adding new artists so I would recommend checking out one of the existing artists.  Here is a list of a few that are already added:

* The Strokes
* The Killers
* Jay Z

You will need to create an account first.  There is not much validation at the moment so using a fake name/email address is fine.

* Refactor code
* Add the ability to vote for three songs per artist.
